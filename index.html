            The Lion is a powerful animal. They look great and have an awesome roar!
            I've always liked the way they looked; they are just cool animals and seem
            to have an awesome life. The lion and I have some things in common... we like
            to get things done, passionate, and can be lazy. I first fell in love with the lion when
            I watched, The Lion King. Lion King was by far my favorite Disney movie growing up.
            I mean who couldn't love Simba and Mufasa. I love watching the discovery channel around
            I just can't get tired, of learning about them. The lion is definetly the king of the 
            savannah.
